This video talks about all the aspects of the integration between Microsoft Flow and Microsoft Powerapps

Since this is a short video, here is the high-level agenda of what is included

* Executing flow via a press of a button
* Scenario which outputs the result of flow execution back to the PowerApp for any further processing
